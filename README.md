  Hello. 

	I developed this website for a friend, who owns a business, called East Cobb Customs.  East Cobb Customs does work creating automotive wrapping for all vehicular types, (e.g.  automotive, aircraft, and boat.  He began promoting his work through social media sites, like Facebook, and Twitter. 

	The website contains a home page, a portfolio page, an about page, and a contact page.  
    
    The home page holds the site logo.   The portfolio page holds images and navigation.  The about page is mostly Lorem Ipsum, and a link to follow on social media.  The contact page has several ways to contact the company owner. 

	The following components were used to build this site.  A  jquery slick-slider carousel, which uses navigation arrows.  A light-box for the images, and a mobile drop-down menu, for use on mobile devices.

	To view the images in the carousel, use the navigation arrows on the left and right sides of the portfolio page.  In the portfolio page, the images can be viewed in more detail, by clicking on each one.  To apply the mobile drop down menu,  in the portfolio page, click the square at the top of the screen between the minimize button and the X.  

	Next, click the x and then the drop-down menu bar. This will bring up the mobile view.  To navigate the mobile layout use the navigation arrows.  To view the image using the light-box click on the image.  To exit the mobile drop-down, click the square at the top of the screen between the minimize button and the X.  

Thank you for visiting, please come again, soon
